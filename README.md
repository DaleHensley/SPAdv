## Installing the application
> Note: Installing a new APK will delete all the templates from the previous app. You must manually load the templates back onto the phone after the new APK is installed.
* Minimum Requirements:  
    * Android 4.4.x (API 19) and 1GB storage available
    * Android file browser: [ASTRO File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metago.astro&hl=en) or [File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asus.filemanager&hl=en) by ZenUI  
* Prepare your Android device: 
    * If you have installed Story Producer before, delete the previous version. (This will delete the template folders.)
    * Enable a manual install of apk file: 
        * Settings(gear icon) -> Security -> (scroll down) Enable "Unknown sources"; disable "Verify apps"
    * Insert SD card if desired
         * You will need approximately 1 GB of storage for each story you wish to produce.
    * Connect to your device via USB (it will show as a drive on your computer)
        * If it does not show up as a drive, swipe down from the top.  You should see a notification: USB for charging.  Touch it.  Select USB for file transfer.
    * Download StoryProducer_v1.2.apk [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw7whhMtjqJTY1dxM0UyOE1qREk) and copy the file onto your phone or tablet. Use your file manager on your Android device to open the apk and install it onto your device.  Then open Story Producer and close it.  (This will create the org.sil.storyproducer directory)
    * Reboot the device  
    * Download the [template folders](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw7whhMtjqJTVkljWlY0akZXeDg?usp=sharing) to your computer
    * Copy the unzipped templates folder and projects folder to your device under **Android/data/org.sil.storyproducer/files/**
        * using an SD card to conserve space may be a good idea
    * After you restart Story Producer, you should see the templates avalable. 
        * If not, in the Template screen, you might need to tap the language icon in the top right corner to bring up a Change Language window with a drop down menu.  Tap the Language you want and SAVE.
